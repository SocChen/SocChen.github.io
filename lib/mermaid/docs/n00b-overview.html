There is no disputing that they are indeed very useful. Yet very few people use them, even fewer still do so, for documentation.</p>
<p>mermaid aims to change that. </p>

<p>In an environment of constantly changing information , diagrams/charts become obsolete/inaccurate very fast. This hobbles the information transfer and productivity in teams.</p>
<h1 id="Doc-Rot-kills-Diagrams"><a href="#Doc-Rot-kills-Diagrams" class="headerlink" title="Doc Rot kills Diagrams"></a>Doc Rot kills Diagrams</h1><p>The fast setting Doc-Rot in diagrams makes it quite hard to rationalize taking hours in a desktop application, to produce a diagram that you would need to recreate again the following week in order to account for updates and changes in the app you are documenting. Yet that is often the reality for diagrams and charts and the people who make them.</p>
<p>mermaid seeks to change that. mermaid is a javascript based tool that utilizes a markdown inspired syntax to generate documentation, which is actually quicker, less complicated and more convenient than most traditional diagramming software. This is a relatively straightforward solution to a major hurdle in software teams.  </p>

<pre><code>graph TD
A[Client] --&gt; B[Load Balancer]
B --&gt; C[Server01]
B --&gt; D[Server02]</code></pre>
<p>And they are rendered into this and made part of the documentation:</p>

<p>Because, the text base for  diagrams allows for it to be updated easily, it can also be made part of production scripts (and other pieces of code). So less time needs be spent on documenting, as a separate task. </p>
